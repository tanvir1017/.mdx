#

# 3️⃣ Text formatting

    ⚙️ Spacing

- we can do line break by entering a space between a line. Let's see an example:

➡️ This is text formatting

importantly

    ⚙️ italic text by giving (*) sign start and in a text or by giving (_) sign start & end

- _this is an italic text_ OR _also this is an italic text_

---

    ⚙️ we can use bold text by giving (**) sign beginning & end at the text. Let's see example:

**this is a bold text** ALSO **this a boldText**

    ⚙️We can also use italic and bold by adding (***) or (___) at the beginning. Let's see example:

**_this is a bold text_** ALSO **_this a boldText_**

    ⚙️ We can use strike through by putting two tildes (~~) at the beginning and ending of the text. Let's see example:

~~hello strike through~~

# Order list

    ⚙️ We can use order list as simple like (1.) at the beginning then it will be list item. Let's see example:

## Here is the order list

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

# Code Formatting

### Inline code :

we can use code formatting in any text by wrapping text with backTick

`function = (a, b) => {
    return a+b
}`

---

---

### Fenced block:

    ➡️ using three backTick at the beginning and ending of the text it will behave your code as vscode. also you can highlight code formatting by putting programming language name after first three backtick

```js
const checkFencedBlockCodeFormatting = async() => {
    return await for javascript language 😃
}
```

# Block quotes

    ➡️ We can use block quote by putting (>) symbol at the beginning of the text. For an example:

> This is a block quote.
>
> > hello! wow this is nested block quote
>
> we can also use nested block quote by putting two of this (>) symbol at the beginning.

# Links

    ➡️ Links generally follow this signature [](). The square bracket for which word or text will be link & the parenthesis for putting the source. Let's see an example:

. 🧑‍🚀🚀 Normal Link : [Github](https://github.com/tanvir1017)

. 🧑‍🚀🚀 Normal Link reference: [Github][git]

. 🧑‍🚀🚀 Link with title : [Github](https://github.com/tanvir1017 "tanvir github")

. 🧑‍🚀🚀 Header links with title: [code formatting](#code-formatting "code formatting")

## . 🧑‍🚀🚀 Referential links with title:

[git]: https://github.com/tanvir1017 "Tanvir's github"

# ! [ Images ]

    ➡️ Images start with ![]() => square bracket for alt text and parenthesis for source. Also 🖇️ if you want to link up the image you can wrap everything in [] this bracket and () for where img goes to. Let's see an example:

### 🧑‍🚀🚀 without link

![alt text goes here](/images/typescript.png)

### 🧑‍🚀🚀 with link

[![alt text goes here](/images/typescript.png)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets "typescript chat shit")

# Table 🪢

![table picture](/images//table.png)

    (|) by putting this symbol we can specify the column. : colon for alignment. In the picture you can see left side colon for left align, right colon for right align & both side colon for middle align
